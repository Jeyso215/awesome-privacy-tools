The service was launched on February 21, 2022. Since mid-2022, Truth Social has been facing financial and regulatory issues. The application was initially not available on Google Play because of violations of Google policies prohibiting content with physical threats and incitement to violence, but was approved for Google Play in October 2022 after agreeing to enforce policies against incitement.

As of March 15, 2024, it was ranked number 38 in Apple's App Store rankings for social media apps, and Similarweb ranked its website as number 203 in their "News & Media Publishers" category, behind Gab at number 154, but ahead of Parler at number 1,052. Trump estimated in an April 2023 personal financial disclosure that the site's value ranged from $5 million to $25 million.

Digital World Acquisition Corporation (DWAC), the special-purpose acquisition company formed to fund Truth Social's parent company TMTG and take it public, disclosed in October 2023 that it was refunding to investors the $1 billion it had raised for TMTG. A November 2023 financial disclosure by DWAC indicated that Truth Social had made a cumulative loss of at least $31.5 million since its inception. In March 2024, DWAC shareholders voted to merge with TMTG, with the merged company trading on NASDAQ under the stock ticker DJT.
